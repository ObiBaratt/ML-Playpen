# ML-Playpen
Repo for learning how to host various ML projects. This came about while I was experimenting with creating my own ML models 
and then struggled to figure out what to do with them outside of the local environment where they were created. 
I managed to get image uploading and analysis, and multiple kinds of text sentiment analysis up and running on Heroku. 

The quality of the models isn't anything special, but the learning process of getting things deployed is super important,
nowadays when I mentor people I emphasize setting up a deployment strategy as the first things they do.
